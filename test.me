## Eco-Eats: Personal Nutrition Tracker and Food Expert

### 1. Problem Analysis and Motivation

In today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a balanced diet due to busy lifestyles, lack of nutritional knowledge, or reliance on fast food. While people may track calories informally or through fragmented tools, most existing solutions fail to provide a comprehensive yet simple approach that combines calorie tracking, nutrient breakdown, BMI analysis, and long-term reporting.

Eco-Eats aims to empower individuals to make informed dietary decisions by providing them with an easy-to-use platform for nutrition tracking and analysis. By integrating calorie tracking, nutrient breakdown, BMI calculation, and exportable reports into a single system.

### 2. Literature Review

Digital nutrition tracking has advanced from traditional self-report food diaries to mobile applications and sensor-driven systems. Commercial platforms such as **MyFitnessPal** provide large food databases, barcode scanning, and meal-scan technology to assist users with monitoring dietary intake [1].

Research consistently shows that adherence to dietary logging predicts greater weight loss, with participants who tracked consistently (>66% of days) achieving significantly more outcomes than inconsistent users [2].

More recently, image-based methods using deep learning have improved food recognition and portion estimation, though challenges remain in handling mixed dishes and cultural variability [3]. Emerging sensor-based approaches, such as the *MealMeter* system, integrate physiological and motion data to automate macronutrient estimation with promising accuracy [4].

Despite these innovations, long-term adherence and generalizability across diverse populations remain key challenges. Future systems may need to integrate hybrid approaches, combining manual logging, image recognition, and multimodal sensing for more robust and user-friendly solutions.

### 3. Methodology

The Eco-Eats methodology follows a structured workflow that includes requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and deployment. The system enables users to log meals, calculate calories and nutrients, analyze BMI, and export reports.

### 4. Feasibility Study

#### 4.1 Technical Feasibility
- Cross-platform frameworks (e.g., **Flutter**, **React Native**) can be used for faster development
- Backend development can be done using **Node.js** or **Django**
- Nutrition data can be integrated via publicly available APIs (USDA, Edamam, etc.)
- Cloud hosting platforms (**AWS**, **Firebase**) ensure scalability and high availability
- No reliance on new or experimental technologies

**Conclusion:** The project is technically feasible

#### 4.2 Economic Feasibility
- The use of **open source tools** significantly reduces development costs
- **Cloud hosting costs** can scale according to usage, ensuring flexibility
- A **free initial version** can be launched, with premium features generating revenue later
- Overall development cost is **moderate** and manageable

**Conclusion:** The project is economically viable

#### 4.3 Operational Feasibility
- Target users (students, professionals, health-conscious individuals) are already familiar with **mobile applications**
- A **simple, user-friendly UI** will ensure ease of adoption
- **Health and nutrition tracking** aligns well with existing user habits
- The app fits naturally into users' **daily routines**

**Conclusion:** The project is operationally feasible

### 5. Main Phases

The development of the **Eco-Eats** follows a structured approach to ensure systematic planning, design, implementation, and testing. The main phases of the project are as follows:

- Project proposal and planning
- Requirement specification of the project
- Selection of an appropriate SDLC model (Waterfall/Agile)
- Developing Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the system
- Developing UML Use Case Diagram to capture interactions between users and system
- Developing UML Sequence Diagram for report generation, BMI calculation, and notifications
- Developing UML Class Diagram for data entities such as users, food items, nutrition logs, reports, and administrators
- System development (coding) of daily input, calorie breakdown, and excel export
- Software testing (unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing)
- Deployment and delivery preparation with documentation
